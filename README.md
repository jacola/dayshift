# dayshift

**It turns your issues into PRs, one phase at a time.**

Dayshift is an issue-driven AI agent pipeline that processes GitHub issues through structured phases — Research, Plan, Approve, Implement, and Validate — with human-in-the-loop checkpoints between them.

Inspired by [nightshift](https://github.com/marcus/nightshift), which runs AI coding agents autonomously overnight. While nightshift works while you sleep, dayshift works while you're awake — pausing for your input and resuming when you respond.

## Overview

Add a `dayshift` label to any GitHub issue. Dayshift picks it up, researches your codebase, drafts an implementation plan, asks clarifying questions if needed, waits for your approval, implements the change, validates the result, and opens a PR — all tracked through labels and comments on the issue itself.

## Features

- **Multi-project** — monitor multiple repositories from a single config
- **Session resume** — Copilot sessions persist across phases so the agent retains context
- **Human-in-the-loop** — the pipeline pauses at clarify and approve checkpoints, resuming when you respond
- **Labels as state machine** — every phase transition is visible on the issue as a label change
- **Edit-in-place comments** — plan updates edit the existing comment instead of posting new ones
- **Multiple AI providers** — supports Claude, Codex, and Copilot with configurable preference order
- **Daemon mode** — run as a background polling service or trigger manually

## Installation

### From source

```bash
go install github.com/marcus/dayshift/cmd/dayshift@latest
```

### Binary downloads

Prebuilt binaries for macOS and Linux (amd64, arm64) are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/marcus/dayshift/releases) page.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create a config file
dayshift init

# 2. Edit ~/.config/dayshift/config.yaml to add your projects

# 3. Create labels on your repositories
dayshift labels setup

# 4. Add the "dayshift" label to a GitHub issue

# 5. Run
dayshift run
```

## CLI Reference

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `dayshift run` | Process pending issues. Use `--issue` to target one, `--dry-run` to preview. |
| `dayshift status` | Show tracked issues and recent runs. Use `--issue` for details. |
| `dayshift doctor` | Check config, tools (`gh`, `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`), and database health. |
| `dayshift daemon start` | Start the background polling daemon. `--foreground` to stay attached. |
| `dayshift daemon stop` | Stop the daemon (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 10s). |
| `dayshift daemon status` | Check whether the daemon is running. |
| `dayshift labels setup` | Create all 13 dayshift labels on configured repos. `--repo` to target one. |
| `dayshift init` | Generate `~/.config/dayshift/config.yaml`. `--force` to overwrite. |

See [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md) for the full reference with all flags and examples.

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.config/dayshift/config.yaml`. Run `dayshift init` to generate a starter file.

```yaml

  - repo: owner/repo
    path: ~/code/repo
    priority: 10

schedule:
  poll_interval: 5m

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Research

The AI agent reads the issue and researches the relevant parts of your codebase. Its findings are posted as a comment on the issue wrapped in `<!-- dayshift:research -->` markers. The `dayshift:researched` label is added.

### Phase 2: Plan

Using the research output, the agent drafts an implementation plan. If it has questions, they're posted as checkboxes in a `<!-- dayshift:questions -->` section and the issue moves to **Clarify**. If no questions, the plan is posted (or edited in-place if updating) and the issue moves to **Approve**.

### Phase 2a: Clarify

The pipeline pauses. You answer by checking boxes or replying with a comment. On the next scan, dayshift detects your response and re-runs the plan phase with your answers folded in. This loops up to `max_clarify_rounds` times (default: 3).

### Phase 3: Approve

A comment is posted asking you to review the plan. Add the `dayshift:approved` label when you're ready. If `auto_approve` is enabled, this step is skipped.

### Phase 4: Implement

The agent creates a branch, implements the plan, and opens a pull request with `Fixes #N` in the description. The PR URL is stored in the database for the next phase.

### Phase 5: Validate

The agent reviews the PR against the original issue and plan. If validation passes, the issue is marked `dayshift:complete`. If it fails, `dayshift:needs-fixes` is added and the issue can cycle back through implementation.

### Error Handling

If any phase fails, the `dayshift:error` label is added and a comment with the error details is posted. Remove the error label and re-add `dayshift` to retry.

## Label Protocol

Dayshift uses 13 labels to track state. Run `dayshift labels setup` to create them.
